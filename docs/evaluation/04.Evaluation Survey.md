The aim of this experiment is to investigate the scale of usability for an application that is designed for developers, such as yourself, to understand their development process. Before you decide whether you want to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what your participation will involve. You should only participate if you want to; choosing not to take part will not disadvantage you in any way, and you are welcome to withdraw at any time. If you do so, then it will not be possible for you to be debriefed about the purposes of the experiment. Please take time to read the following information carefully and ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. For questions, you can send an email to Inesh Bose: 2504266b@student.gla.ac.uk

The application "Code Fitness" was created as an MSci Research Project with the target to help individual and/or teams of developers understand the state of their project easily through a centralised dashboard that would present information that they are interested in - similar to a fitness app like Google Fit that allows users to toggle statistics - so that their (development) journey can be realised accordingly. You are asked to make use of this dashboard to analyse the development of a project as a demonstration and provide feedback. You are free to not answer questions that are not required, but the data will help. All responses are anonymous and in compliance with GDPR and the University of Glasgow SoCS Project Ethics.

## Project Study

You will now be introduced to the project that the dashboard is being demonstrated on.

"Portion Mate" is a mobile app created as a Level 4 Dissertation Project with the target to help users keep track of their daily portion count from each food group based on the NHS Eatwell Guide. It is developed using React Native in TypeScript with a Django backend server to store user data. The remote repository is public and hosted on GitHub with all information about the project linked from it - this includes all documentation, internal meeting agendas, project timeline and issue tracking.

You are asked to spend between 5-10 minutes navigating through the GitHub repository to gain some understanding about the project to help answer the next set of questions.

## Debrief

With this, the survey ends and you will be debriefed about this experiment.

The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the usability of a daily food portion count tracker application (called Code Fitness). This meant navigating through the dashboard, interacting with elements, judging visualisations and appeal of the design. Your responses would help point out and understand any frustrations or problems that might have occurred during your experience.

If you would like to know and see more about this project, everything (including the source code) can be found on this GitHub repository: https://github.com/ineshbose/code-fitness. This repository acts as the single source of truth for all information regarding Code Fitness. This would also mean participant feedback and data analysis, therefore if you would like to aid this practice, you can confirm your responses being held in this public repository anonymously. By default, your data will not be public and on the repository, if you do not agree. It will help more developers gather insight and refer to data for making better applications for the world in the future.

For more questions and concerns, you can send an email to Inesh Bose: 2504266b@student.gla.ac.uk
