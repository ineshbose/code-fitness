The aim of this experiment is to investigate the usability of Code Fitness - an application that is designed for developers, such as yourself, to understand their development process. You are being asked to complete this survey as part of the continuous experiment; remember that you should only participate if you want to; choosing not to take part will not disadvantage you in any way, and you are welcome to withdraw at any time. If you do so, then it will not be possible for you to be debriefed about the purposes of the experiment. Please take time to answer the following questions carefully and ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information.
For questions, you can send an email to Inesh Bose: 2504266b@student.gla.ac.uk
