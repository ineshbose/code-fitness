<!-- > **Warning**
> This survey did not take place. -->

The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the Code Fitness dashboard for its usability. This is the final step of the evaluation being conducted with teams using formalised methods of software development such as issue tracking, standups, and retrospectives. It involves studies, discussions and interviews about the developer journey over the weeks of using the dashboard; these would be recorded and transcribed for research analysis. This experiment should take 30-45 minutes. You should only participate if you want to; choosing not to take part will not disadvantage you in any way, and you are welcome to withdraw at any time. If you do so, then it will not be possible for you to be debriefed about the purposes of the experiment.

For questions, you can raise them or send an email to Inesh Bose: 2504266b@student.gla.ac.uk
