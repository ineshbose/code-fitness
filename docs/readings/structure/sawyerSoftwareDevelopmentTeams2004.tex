\section{Software development teams}

\subsection{Abstract}

Considering three software development team archetypes and their implications.

Software development is an impressively complex
socio-technical activity. It requires people to
interact with each other and with both the
technical methods and computing technologies
they use to perform their work [3]. Analytically,
the social aspects of software development
include how people interact, behave, and organize.
Technical aspects of software development include
the use of production methods, development
techniques, and computing technologies. In
practice, it is difficult to disentangle the way
people do things from the methods, techniques,
and computing technologies they use [6].

\subsection{What were they trying to do}

Focus on the ways software developers organize therefore highlight how software production methods, techniques and tools are enmeshed in and enacted through the structures and interactions of the professionals who work together to build software.

Fundamental question: What can we learn about software development by privileging the social perspective?

\subsection{What did they do}

Three types of generic archetypes of software development teams

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sequence}
    \item \textbf{Group}
    \item \textbf{Network}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What did they learn}

Hybrid approaches exist.
