\section{Succession: Measuring Transfer of Code and Developer Productivity}

\subsection{Abstract}

Code ownership transfer or succession is a crucial
ingredient in open source code reuse and in offshoring
projects. Measuring succession can help understand
factors that affect the success of such transfers and
suggest ways to make them more efficient. We propose and evaluate several methods to measure succession based on the chronology and traces of developer
activities. Based on ten instances of offshoring succession identified through interviews, we find that the best
succession measure can accurately pinpoint the most
likely mentors. We model the productivity ratio of more
than 1000 developer pairs involved in the succession to
test conjectures based on the organizational socialization theory and find the ratio to decrease for instances
of offshoring and for mentors who have worked primarily on a single project or have transferred ownership for their non-primary project code, thus supporting a theory-based conjectures and providing practical
suggestions on how to improve succession.

\subsection{What were they trying to do}

Measuring productivity by the means of successful deliveries

Our primary goal is to create methods to identify instances
of succession under the assumption that simpler and
direct but intrusive approaches, such as interviews, are
too costly, impractical, or impossible in many real-life
scenarios. A second goal is to investigate the effects of
succession on developer productivity given that costreductions is a common reason to implement succession
