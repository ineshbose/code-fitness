# Project Research Readings in Computing Science

This directory holds the papers written for the PRRCS course in-line with this research project.

The course, carried out by Dr. Stephen McQuistin, aims to immerse students in research topics in specialist areas of Computing Science by reinforce critical reading and reviewing skills (as taught in the Research Methods and Techniques course), to enable students to develop critical thinking and scientific writing capabilities, and to develop students' presentation skills; it's assessed 100% by coursework.

## Proposal Outline (_[`outline.tex`](/docs/prrcs/outline.tex)_)

Write a 1 page proposal outline that is the outcome of a wide and thorough literature survey (around 20 papers is recommended) in the broad area of the project work. This survey, in addition to the project, formulates an ambitious grant proposal, with a reasonably large scope serving as the basis for the grant proposal and presentation. The page limit does not include references, and the outline must use a 10-point, 2 column format - template provided.

This assessment's worth 15% of the overall mark for this course, and due 5pm on Friday 3rd February 2023.

## Research Grant Proposal (_[`grant.tex`](/docs/prrcs/grant.tex)_)

Write a 6-page research grant proposal, suitable for submission to the EPSRC as a “Case for Support”. Guidance on the content of a case for support is provided on the EPSRC website at <https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/applicationprocess/preparing/writing/caseforsupport/>. The proposal should be formatted into two columns, on A4 pages with 1.5cm margins, and a 10pt font; A LaTeX template that conforms to these requirements was provided. The proposal must not exceed 6 pages in length.

This assessment's worth 50% of the grade for this course, and due 5pm on Friday 3rd March 2023.

## Poster (_[`poster.tex`](/docs/prrcs/poster.tex)_)

Prepare an A1-sized research poster that presents the idea proposed in previous assessments.

This assessment's worth 30% of the grade, and due 5pm on Friday 17th March 2023.

## Peer review

Participate in peer review rounds for both the proposal outline and research grant proposal submissions providing feedback for 2-4 submissions from other students. Conducted over [Aropa](https://aropa.gla.ac.uk/).

The peer review was worth 5% of the grade; due 5pm on Friday 27th January 2023 for the proposal outline, and 5pm on Friday 24th February 2023 for the research grant proposal.
