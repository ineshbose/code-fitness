# `@code-fitness/server`

## Purpose

The server provides many purposes of various types like a database connection, endpoints for data, and proxies for external APIs.

## Nitro

Built using [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io) using file-based routing, so relatively easier than frameworks like Express.

## Deployment

Currently deployed on Vercel (free) and using Upstash Redis (free) for storage.
